# Raspberry Pi 'Simon Says' Game

Python code for a Simon Says game created for the Raspberry Pi. The twist: It is able to submit player scores to a web server.

Created for the COMP 4400 (Systems Development and Implementation) course at the Inter-American University of Puerto Rico, Bayamón Campus, with Prof. José De Abongüez.

*Coming soon*: allow player to enter their name to submit with their score.
*To-do*: improve button feedback during gameplay.
